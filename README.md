## Explanation

As rebuilding the wheel is very important and useful to learn and understand how things works, but frequently counterproductive to quickly produce solutions to problematics, working on equations solving "manually" (with a pen and some paper) is very interesting to learn how mathematicals concepts works, but probably a waste of time to solve daily problems which can be depicted by an equation system (linear equations, mathematical objects that correspond to specific characteristics, ...).

Moreover, be efficient to solve equations at large involve to practice every day those kind of skill, solving techniques, tips and tricks, and still, the probability of making mistake is clearly bigger than if a machine does it.

This is why I personally consider that the real challenge in solving an abstract or concrete problem is its mathematical modeling and equation in order to determine all its possible solutions and to be able to choose the best one knowingly. Once the equation is posed, the use of a calculator is essential in order to quickly obtain the solution, to overcome the problems of calculation and thus free from the mental load to focus on the problem itself and its best possible resolution.
